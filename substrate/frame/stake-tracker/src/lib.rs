//! # StakeTracker
//!
//! FRAME stake tracker pallet
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! The stake-tracker pallet listens to staking events through implementing the
//! [`OnStakingUpdate`] trait and forwards those events to one or multiple types (e.g. pallets) that
//! must be kept track of the stake and staker's state. The pallet does not expose any
//! callables and acts as a multiplexer of staking events.
//!
//! Currently, the stake tracker pallet is used to update a voter and target sorted target list
//! implemented through the bags lists pallet.
//!
//! ## Goals
//!
//! The [`OnStakingUpdate`] implementation aims at achieving the following goals:
//!
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] keeps a sorted list of validators, sorted by approvals
//! (which include self-vote and nominations).
//! * The [`Config::VoterList`] keeps a sorted list of voters, sorted by bonded stake.
//! * The [`Config::TargetList`] sorting must be *always* kept up to date, even in the event of new
//! nomination updates, nominator/validator slashes and rewards.
//!
//! Note that from the POV of this pallet, all events will result in one or multiple
//! updates to the [`Config::VoterList`] and/or [`Config::TargetList`] state. If a update or set of
//! updates require too much weight to process (e.g. at nominator's rewards payout or at nominator's
//! slashes), the event emitter should handle that in some way (e.g. buffering events).
//!
//! ## Event emitter ordering and staking ledger state updates
//!
//! It is important to ensure that the events are emitted from staking (i.e. the calls into
//! [`OnStakingUpdate`]) *after* the caller ensures that the state of the staking ledger is up to
//! date, since the new state will be fetched and used to update the sorted lists accordingly.
