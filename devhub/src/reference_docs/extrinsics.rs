//! Reference documentation for the different types of extrinsics and how to construct them.
//!
//! An extrinsic is some data that can be added to a block, and is either signed (a transaction) or
//! unsigned (an inherent).
//!
//! > Note: The term "call", "extrinsic", and "dispatchable" often get mixed together.
//! > Here is a sentence which should help clarify their relationship, and why they are such similar
//! > terms:
//! > **Users submit an **extrinsic** to the blockchain, which is **dispatched** to a Pallet
//! > **call**.**
